## Usage

**Option 1**. Open Live Version:

[https://nikoboi.dev/bingo](https://nikoboi.dev/bingo)

**Option 2**: Download & Run Locally:

>> Not recommended, as you wont have HTTPS, which is annoying on *some* secure browsers

1. Create a folder anywhere, open the terminal in it and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/nikoboinftb.github.io .
```

>> Using `.` clones the files into the current directory. So create the folder first.

2. Start a local Python server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5500
```

>> Requires Python

3. Visit your server [here](http://localhost:5500/bingo/).

You can also open `http://<your-PC-ip>:5500/bingo/` on any device in your LAN.
