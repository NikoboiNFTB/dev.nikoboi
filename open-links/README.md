# Bulk Open Links  

**Bulk Open Links** is a lightweight, open-source web tool that allows you to quickly open multiple URLs at once. Simply paste full links (one per line) into the text box, and the app will open all of them in new browser tabs.  

This tool is excellent to use as an add-on for Link Gopher, available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/link-gopher/) and [Chromium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/link-gopher/bpjdkodgnbfalgghnbeggfbfjpcfamkf).

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically ignores invalid or incomplete URLs
  - Links need to begin with `http://` or `https://`  
- Clean, dark-themed interface  
- Fully client-side (no data is sent anywhere)  
- Simple and open-source
