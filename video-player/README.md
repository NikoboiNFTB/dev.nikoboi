# Bulk Video Player

A simple web app that allows you to bulk add video players by pasting URLs from the 111Movies website. The app dynamically embeds the video players in an easy-to-use interface. You can then use [Video DownloadHelper](https://www.downloadhelper.net/) to download all embedded content at once.

**Note:** This project is made for desktop. Mobile usage is untested.

Before using the app, make sure you have:

1. [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/thanks/) installed.  
2. [Video DownloadHelper](https://www.downloadhelper.net/) extension installed in Firefox.  

> This web app is built around the extension, which only works in Firefox.

### Step 1: Run the App

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Bulk-Video-Player
     ```
   - Or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Bulk-Video-Player/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it.

### Step 2: Add Players

1. Paste **one or more URLs** from 111Movies into the input box (one per line).
